# catalaMorph

## Welcome
  Hey all, I am working on a morphological analyzer of Catalan, based on the works listed on [Noah Smith](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/ "Noah Smith\'s Website")
  
  Some of those examples are [here](https://github.com/kartikgo/NLPlab--11-712 "here") and [here](https://github.com/bolei/bofinger/ "here").


## Disclaimer

This is very much so a work in progress, and you can expect that it may not work and / or that it is not complete
